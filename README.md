# Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews using RNN

--- 

## Overview

Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine whether data is positive, negative. 
It is applied on text data. This project is a mini project in the Deep Learning Nanodegree at Udacity. 

--- 

## Dataset

The dataset consists of positive and negative reviews of movie. It is prepared by Udacity.

## Project Steps

The high-level steps of the project include:
1.	Data preprocessing (include tokenization, remove outliers, padding/truncate and split the data)
2.	Build RNN network (Embedding layer, LSTM layer and fully connected layer)
3.	Training and testing
4.	Inference

## Results

I test the model with my own reviews, the results are showed below. 

- "I really like it!" >> Positive review detected!
- "I really do not like it!" >> Negative review detected.

## Requirements	
- Python 3.7
- Numpy 
- Torch
- Jupyter Notebook
- Maybe needs to use GPU

## Running the project
The whole project is located in the jupyter notebook file ``` Sentiment_RNN_Exercise.ipynb ```, you can use the Anaconda environment to open the Jupyter Notebook and install the requirement.
